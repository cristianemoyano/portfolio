My first team was Pricing, focused on pricing and tax rules for the whole company. One of my first project was to develop from scratch (data models, API, application, rollout) an admin tool to manage Tax Regimes for Organizers based in Argentina for the Finance team. This tool was built in React. One feature interesting of this tool was to handle file uploads through Amazon S3. In addition for this project I had to create a script that was scheduled by a cron job."
